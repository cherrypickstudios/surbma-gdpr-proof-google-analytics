Adds a GDPR compatible Google Analytics tracking to your website. It will ask every new visitor to approve or decline Google Analytics tracking.

== Description ==

This plugin makes your Google Analytics tracking GDPR proof by asking every visitors to accept or decline Google Analytics tracking. If visitor choose to decline, than no visitor data will be sent to Google Analytics. If visitor accepts tracking, than data will be sent to Google Analytics. So visitors can choose to be tracked or not, before they visit any page of the website.

The cookie saved by this plugin is not storing any personally sensitive data, it is storing only two fix values: "yes" or "no". This cookie management is GDPR proof, as it is impossible to identify any user with the cookie data. Cookies will expire in 30 days by default.

**Limited Liability:** This plugin does not substitute any legal adequacy. Texts, that are displayed in the popup is edited by the user of this plugin and I do not take any responsibility regarding GDPR adequacy or change.

**Cookie Policy:** Set youy Cookie Policy page, where the popup won't load for visitors. Google Analytics tracking code is not loading on this page!

**Developer Friendly:** If you enable debug mode, popup will show always, on every refresh, so you can test how it works.

**WPML Compatible:** If you have a multilingual website, you can set the texts for each language with WPML String Translation add-on.

**Full Customizations:** Every text is customizable, even the button's texts! You can also set the design of the buttons.

**Cookie Policy Link:** Show your Cookie Policy page link in the popup.

**Themes:** There are popup themes to choose the design, you like. The Full Page Themes are hiding the entire content behind the popup. There are a lot of design settings to make the popup fit your website design. Dark mode is also available.

**Full Cookie Control:** Set cookie expiration for visitors, so the popup won't show again in X days, you set.

**IP Anonymization:** You might need to disable IP Anonymization of the hit sent to Google Analytics. This setting is active by default to ensure the maximum GDPR compliance, but you can disable this option.

**Google Analytics Tracking Code Customizations:** Choose between gtag.js framework or analytics.js library. You can also set, if you want to track logged in users or the admin area.
